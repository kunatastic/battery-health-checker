# battery-health-checker

Hello, This is a fun little script to check the battery health of my laptop. From overcharging to undercharging it, now I can keep proper track of battery health with this script. Every time the battery is over-charged or under-charged, a pop-up will appear to remind stop/start the charging back again.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunatastic/battery-health-checker
```

2. Execute the `run.cmd` file

```bash
.\run.cmd
```

> If want to configure the script to run in background use ```.\run_bg.cmd```

If you want to configure the script to run on startup please follow this [article](https://jd-bots.com/2021/05/15/how-to-run-powershell-script-on-windows-startup/)

## Thanks, Have a nice day
